## Overview

React Chart.js leverages the Chart.js library within React applications, providing a declarative API for constructing charts with the flexibility and customization that Chart.js offers. It enables developers to easily implement and customize charts such as line, bar, radar, doughnut, and pie charts, integrating seamlessly with React's component structure.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: Utilize React components to define charts, making your code more readable and easier to maintain.
- **Chart.js Integration**: Inherits the power and flexibility of Chart.js, offering a wide variety of chart types and options for customization.
- **Responsive Charts**: Automatically create responsive charts that fit the screen size and resolution.
- **Dynamic Updates**: React Chart.js components can dynamically update and render charts when data changes, taking advantage of React's efficient DOM updates.
- **Customization and Extensibility**: Provides extensive options for customizing chart styles, colors, labels, and animations, as well as the ability to extend default functionality.

  labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
  datasets: [
    {
      label: 'My First dataset',
      fill: false,
      lineTension: 0.1,
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,0.4)',
      borderColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,1)',
      borderCapStyle: 'butt',

      pointHoverBackgroundColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,1)',
      pointHoverBorderColor: 'rgba(220,220,220,1)',
      pointHoverBorderWidth: 2,
      pointRadius: 1,
      pointHitRadius: 10,
      data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40]
    }
  ]
};

function LineChartExample() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Line Example</h2>
      <Line data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
