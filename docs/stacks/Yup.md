## Overview

Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. It adopts a declarative approach to validate complex data structures, providing a simple and efficient way to ensure data integrity. Yup allows for defining a schema with a wide range of built-in validators for various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, dates, and more. It is particularly useful in frontend applications for form validation, as well as in backend applications for data validation before persistence.

## Key Features

- **Expressive API**: Offers a fluent and expressive API for defining schemas and validations, making the code easy to write and understand.
- **TypeScript Support**: Comes with TypeScript definitions, providing auto-completion and type safety for schemas.
- **Custom Validators**: Supports custom validation functions, allowing for complex validations that are not covered by the built-in validators.
- **Asynchronous Validation**: Can perform both synchronous and asynchronous validations, useful for validations that require server-side checks.
- **Casting**: Provides the ability to coerce values to a specified type, making it easier to clean and transform data.
- **Extensibility**: Allows for extending existing types with custom logic, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of schemas.
- **Integration Friendly**: Works well with popular frameworks and libraries like React and Formik, streamlining the process of form validation.

## Installation

You can add Yup to your project using npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install yup --save
# or
yarn add yup
```

## Example Usage

Below is a simple example of how to define a schema and validate data using Yup:

```javascript
const yup = require('yup');

// Define a schema
const schema = yup.object().shape({
  name: yup.string().required(),
  age: yup.number().required().positive().integer(),
  email: yup.string().email(),
  website: yup.string().url()
});

// Validate an object against the schema
schema
  .validate({
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 29,
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    website: 'https://example.com'
  })
  .then(function(valid) {
    console.log(valid); // => true
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error(err); // => ValidationError
  });
```
