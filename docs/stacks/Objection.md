# Objection.js Technical Summary

## Overview

Objection.js is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for Node.js that aims to stay as close as possible to the syntax and features of SQL. Built on the powerful SQL query builder Knex.js, it provides a rich set of tools and techniques for working with relational databases in a more intuitive and flexible way. Objection.js supports various SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3, and more.

## Key Features

- **Elegant Syntax**: Leverages the full power of SQL with a minimalistic API, making code more readable and maintainable.
- **Relation Mapping**: Offers comprehensive support for expressing complex relationships between tables.
- **Eager Loading**: Allows for efficient loading of complex nested relations with a simple and straightforward syntax.
- **Transaction Support**: Easy transaction management that can automatically rollback in case of errors, enhancing data integrity.
- **Validator Integration**: Built-in support for model validation using JSON Schema or custom validators, ensuring data consistency.
- **Dynamic Query Building**: Utilizes Knex.js for constructing queries, enabling dynamic query building and advanced SQL features.
- **Plugins and Extensions**: Supports custom plugins and extensions, allowing developers to extend and customize their ORM layer as needed.

## Installation

To install Objection.js, you first need to have Knex.js installed and configured. Then, you can add Objection.js to your project using npm:

```bash
npm install objection knex --save
```

Make sure you also install the appropriate database driver for Knex.js, such as `pg` for PostgreSQL, `mysql` for MySQL, etc.

## Example Usage

Below is a simple example of defining a model and performing a query with Objection.js:

```javascript
// Import objection Model and Knex
const { Model } = require('objection');
const Knex = require('knex');

// Initialize Knex connection
const knex = Knex({
  client: 'postgresql',
  useNullAsDefault: true,
  connection: {
    database: 'your_database',
    user: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password'
  }
});

// Bind all Models to the knex instance
Model.knex(knex);

// Define a model
class Person extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'persons';
  }
}

// Fetch all persons with their pets
Person.query()
  .withGraphFetched('pets')
  .then(persons => console.log(persons))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
