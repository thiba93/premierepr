# Airneis Tech Stack Detailed Summary

Welcome to the Airneis project! This document provides a detailed overview of the technologies we've chosen to create a robust, scalable, and efficient e-commerce platform. Our tech stack is carefully selected to optimize both development workflows and user experiences across web and mobile platforms.

## Front-End Technologies

### React

- **Description**: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables us to create reusable UI components.
- **Why React?**: We chose React for its component-based architecture, which allows for a more organized codebase and reusability across the project. React's ecosystem, including hooks and context, enables us to manage state and side effects in a more readable and maintainable way.

### React Native

- **Description**: React Native lets us build mobile applications using the same design principles as React, but for iOS and Android platforms.
- **Why React Native?**: It allows for a single codebase for both platforms, significantly reducing development time and effort. React Native's live reload and hot reload features make the development process smoother and faster.

### Next.js

- **Description**: Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and many other features for web applications.
- **Why Next.js?**: We leverage Next.js for its out-of-the-box features like server-side rendering, which improves SEO and load times. Next.js also simplifies routing and page-based organization, enhancing our application's scalability and maintainability.

### Tailwind CSS

- **Description**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without having to leave your HTML.
- **Why Tailwind CSS?**: It accelerates the development process by reducing the need to write custom CSS. Tailwind's responsive design features and utility classes make it easy to design consistently and responsively across different devices.

### Formik

- **Description**: Formik is a small library that helps manage form states in React.
- **Why Formik?**: It simplifies form handling by taking care of the repetitive and tedious tasks involved in form state management. Formik's integration with Yup for validation schemas ensures that our forms are both powerful and user-friendly.

### Yup

- **Description**: Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
- **Why Yup?**: Combined with Formik, Yup provides a straightforward way to create validation schemas for our forms, ensuring data integrity and providing user feedback on errors.

## Back-End Technologies

### Node.js and Express.js

- **Description**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js.
- **Why Node.js and Express.js?**: This combination offers a lightweight and flexible server-side solution, making it easy to build efficient, scalable APIs. Express.js simplifies routing, middleware integration, and more, providing a robust foundation for our back-end services.

### Knex.js

- **Description**: Knex.js is a SQL query builder for JavaScript, supporting PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift.
- **Why Knex.js?**: It enables us to write SQL queries in a more manageable and readable way. Knex's method chaining and migration features also help us manage database schemas and seeds effectively.

### Objection.js

- **Description**: Objection.js is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for Node.js that builds on the SQL query builder Knex.js.
- **Why Objection.js?**: It allows us to work with database models in a more intuitive and JavaScript-friendly way. Objection.js provides a rich model-based API for interacting with the database, making CRUD operations simpler and more efficient.

## Database

### PostgreSQL

- **Description**: PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database.
- **Why PostgreSQL?**: It offers advanced features, such as complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, views, and transactional integrity, crucial for the data integrity and flexibility required in our e-commerce platform.

## Data Visualization

### React Chart.js

- **Description**: React wrapper for Chart.js, a simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers.
- **Why React Chart.js?**: It allows us to create dynamic charts and graphs for data visualization within our React applications. React Chart.js makes it easy to implement and customize charts that are both beautiful and interactive.

## Development Practices

We emphasize modern development practices to ensure our team's productivity and the reliability of our application. We use GitHub for version control and collaboration, ensuring that our development process is smooth and that changes are properly tracked and reviewed.

Our CI/CD pipeline, implemented using GitHub Actions, automates testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring that our application is always in a deployable state and that we can deliver updates to our users quickly and reliably.
