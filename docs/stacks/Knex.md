## Installation
To install Knex.js, you need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Run the following command in your project directory:

## Quick Start
Here's a quick example to get started with Knex.js, demonstrating how to set up a connection and execute a simple query:
```javascript
// Require the Knex library and set up the database connection
const knex = require('knex')({
  client: 'pg', // or 'mysql', 'sqlite3', etc.
  connection: {
    host: 'your-database-host',
    user: 'your-database-user',
    password: 'your-database-password',
    database: 'your-database-name'
  }
});

// Execute a query
knex.select('*').from('users').then(users => {
  console.log(users);
}).catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
}).finally(() => {
  // Close the database connection
  knex.destroy();
});
```
