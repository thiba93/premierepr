## Overview

React.js is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple. React.js allows developers to compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Features

- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
- **Virtual DOM**: React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browserâ€™s DOM.
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing UI structure. It looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React implements a unidirectional data flow which makes it easier to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.
- **Ecosystem**: React has a rich ecosystem including libraries like Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and many more.

## Installation

React can be added to a website in one minute as a `<script>` tag, or you can use it as a dependency in your Node.js project.

### In a Webpage

Add React in `<script>` tags in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

### Using npm

Install React with npm:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

## Example Usage

Here is a simple example of a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```
